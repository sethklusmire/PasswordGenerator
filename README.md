# Week3Homework


Password Generator works! Lots of loops and splitting variables. I explain a lot in comments, but the main ideas came from trial and error. Started with only one variable for all my characters. When I had to break up each into prompts I made more variables. Then realized I needed to keep my first variable. Enjoyed this homework.
